## Description

Choose a player to go first. That player throws a die and scores as many points as the total shown on the die providing the die doesnâ€™t roll a 1. The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk rolling a 1) or end his turn.

If the player rolls a 1 his turn is over, he loses all points he accumulated that turn, and he passes the die to the next player.

Play passes from player to player until a winner is determined.

How do you win?
The first player to accumulate 100 or more points wins the game.

## Specs
   Test 1: function Roll()
   Expect(Roll(1)).toEqual("Your turn is over")

   Test 2: function Player()
   Expect(let player).toEqual(new Player())
   Note: This ensures that the constructor function works. 

   Test 3: Player.prototype.calcTurnScore(diceResult)
   Expect(player.calcTurnScore(6)).toEqual(6)
